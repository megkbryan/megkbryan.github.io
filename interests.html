	<h3> School Related </h3>
		<p> Throughout my time at UW-Madison, I have developed a strong interest in behavioral economics as well as data analysis. Specifically, being able to look at a set of data and then come up with stories to match that data. I hope to continue to explore this interest during my three-year long rotational analyst position at Deloitte. After, I hope to pursue grad school in some form. I have yet to decide what that will look like, but as of right now I would be interested in pursuing a Master's in either applied economics or data analytics. </p> <br>

		<p> I am also on the board for the Women in Economics organization here on campus. In my position as Secretary, I am in charge of coordinating all of our communication and supporting the WE mission of striving to promote awareness of gender disparities and barriers within the field of economics and to build a strong welcoming community/network through outreach, mentorships, and by facilitating conversations among women in the field at all levels. </p> <br>

	<h3> Non - School Related </h3>
		<p> Outside of school, I make it a priority to take care of myself both physically and mentally. My favorite activities to stay active are working out, playing basketball, or going for walks. I also am a big Wisconsin sports fan and love to watch games with family and friends. My favorite teams to watch are the Wisconsin Badgers, Green Bay Packers, and the Milwaukee Bucks. I also am big into traveling and trying new things. My favorite places I have visted so far include Jamaica, Costa Rica, and Punta Cana. After graduation and before I start working full-time, I hope to take some time and travel to Europe or possibly Australia. </p> <br>

		<p> Fun facts about me: I am left handed, I am a huge coffee fan, I am an only child, and I love seafood!
